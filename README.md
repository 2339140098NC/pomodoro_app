- The timer count down, it tells how much time left.
- Number on the label decrease by one in every 60 seconds. 
- Once the slider is slided to a position, the progress bar automatically goes to 0%.
- Press the start button, progress bar starts and the label will be counting down from timeSelected to 0.

Plan for the later change: add a stop functionality: after press pressing the start button, it will be replaced by stop button. press the stop button will reset everything(progress bar, timeleft will be reset to "select a time", and the button will be replaced by start button)
